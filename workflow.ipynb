    "### SG Transport Query Agent - Agentic Workflow Demo\n",
    "\n",

    "The system is built using LangGraph to model reasoning, planning, tool execution as separate steps. "

    "#### 1. Problem Statement, Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "Design an **agent based system** that can answer natural language user questions about Singapore public bus transport. Agent will dynamically decide **what information it needs, which tools to invoke, how to present results to individual queries**, rather than relying on a single LLM call.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Agent Responsibilities\n",
    "- Interpret user queries\n",
    "- Identify user intent, relevant entities (e.g. bus stop)\n",
    "- Retrieve transport data from structured datasets\n",
    "- Incorporate contextual constraints such as time of day, weather conditions, holidays/events.\n",
    "- Generate LLM response"

    "#### 2. Tools, Data Source Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Primary Data Source: LTA DataMall Datasets\n",
    "The agent uses JSON datasets provided by LTA DataMall to simulate real-time public transport information. In a production system, these dataset readers can be replaced with authenticated, rate-limited APIs without changing the agent workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Selected Datasets\n",
    "- Bus stops dataset - `BusStops.json`\n",
    "- Bus arrival dataset - `BusArrival.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "**The BusArrival dataset represents a snapshot of arrival information for a single queried bus stop, mirroring the behavior of the real LTA Bus Arrival API.**"

    "#### 3. Agentic Workflow\n",
    "The system is implemented as a **stateful, agentic workflow** rather than a single LLM prompt. Each step in the workflow has a single responsibility, and transitions between steps are explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Agent State \n",
    "Agent operates on a shared state object containing:\n",
    "- **user_query** – raw input from the user\n",
    "- **intent** – inferred intent\n",
    "- **entities** – extracted entities (bus stop, service number)\n",
    "- **context** – time, weather, holiday constraints\n",
    "- **planned_tools** – tools selected for execution\n",
    "- **tool_results** – outputs from dataset-based tools\n",
    "- **final_response** – LLM-generated answer\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Workflow Nodes\n",
    "1. **Input Interpretation**\n",
    "Analyzes the user query to infer intent and extract entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Enrichment**\n",
    "Adds non-user signals such as time of day, weather, and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Planning**\n",
    "Determines which tools need to be invoked and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**\n",
    "Executes dataset-based tools and stores results in state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Synthesis**\n",
    "Uses an LLM to generate a grounded, user-facing response based on:\n",
    "- Tool outputs\n",
    "- Contextual constraints\n",
    "- The original query"
